You can download it by clicking the relevant option in the top menu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I’m not in a position to write a long update, but here are some highlights of the work done so far:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The latest version of MultiMC officially supports Fabric!&lt;/strong&gt; Just press “Install Fabric” in a new workspace (keep in mind that API is separate and has to be installed separately, though).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The biomes API has been merged, after lots of discussion and tweaking. I expect mods using it to come out very soon!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Our rendering subsystem, Indigo, has received a lot of bugfixes - among others, finally allowing Fabric to interoperate properly with ShadersMod-related patches in OptiFine.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;On the development side, Yarn now uses Intermediary for its development mappings format - this prevents pull requests from becoming “outdated” with a new release, and should allow greater flexibility in the future.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Fabric is now out for Minecraft 1.14.4!

This time - 1.14.3! And, as always, with such an update comes a brief overview of recent Fabric ongoings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;mods&quot;&gt;Mods&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a lot of new mods worth checking out for users, but we’ll highlight just a few:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/pictocraft&quot;&gt;Pictocraft&lt;/a&gt;, a tool allowing children with disabilities to communicate in Minecraft with pictograms instead of words. It is a wonderful project and we’d love to see more unique concepts like this developed in the modding scene;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Something a bit more mundane, &lt;a href=&quot;https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/jmx&quot;&gt;JMX&lt;/a&gt;! It extends the vanilla JSON model format with a lot of functionality, such as per-quad render layer/brightness control, retexturing models without spamming data files, and even material-specific shaders!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;b0undarybreaker made &lt;a href=&quot;https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/templates/&quot;&gt;Templates&lt;/a&gt;, a carpentry-esque mod adding (for now, only) slopes! More is planned, so keep an eye out on that one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;toolchain&quot;&gt;Toolchain&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the toolchain work this time around focused in two areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;api&quot;&gt;API&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we have formalized the review process for API pull requests, new features have started to be pulled in. Recently, we’ve finally merged a loot table injection and manipulation API. In addition, many bugs in registry synchronization logic have been squashed, as well as in our rendering patch, “Indigo”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;mapping-tools&quot;&gt;Mapping Tools&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enigma has received a major refactor allowing a JSON-profile-controlled plugin system to be introduced. This will help make it more versatile for other games and environments! We have also started publishing Intermediary mappings standalone, so launchers no longer have to worry about the Yarn build number. In addition, sfPlayer1’s Matcher has received some improvements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;… and, as always, thanks to all of you who support the Fabric project. We’re not going anywhere, and we hope to provide even more fun and useful content and features as we continue! Please stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">As with every new Minecraft version, we get a port of Fabric to it. This time - 1.14.3!

(However, Mojang has already confirmed that this is not &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/slicedlime/status/1132210996582506496&quot;&gt;their final word on the matter&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apologies for the post being a little rushed, I’m rather busy today - but here are the highlights of Fabric development so far!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;users&quot;&gt;Users&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;mods&quot;&gt;Mods&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1.14.1 -&amp;gt; 1.14.2 is a much less invasive update than 1.14 -&amp;gt; 1.14.1 was, so most mods should either already be updated or just work with their 1.14.1/1.14.2-pre builds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;developers&quot;&gt;Developers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve already touched on the developer-side improvements to Loom and Loader in &lt;a href=&quot;https://fabricmc.net/2019/05/24/loader-048.html&quot;&gt;the previous blog post&lt;/a&gt;, so I’ll refrain from repeating myself here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;fabric-api-030&quot;&gt;Fabric API 0.3.0&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally - after way too long, we’re marking Fabric API 0.3.0 as a non-test build. What are the changes, from Fabric API 0.2.x?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest one is &lt;em&gt;modularization&lt;/em&gt;. In short, instead of being one big blob of patches, the API is now a collection of small, purpose-specific patch submodules. For now, this means that it’s easier to replace and update them as needed and that mods with small requirements can just bundle the submodules they need - but there is more we want to achieve with this functionality, especially come the 1.15 cycle. Stay tuned! (It should also help maintain the speed of the snapshot cycle as the API grows.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second biggest feature is &lt;em&gt;the renderer API&lt;/em&gt;. It is our response to the need for extending the powers of static block and item rendering, and after long weeks of consulting and improvements it has finally made it into the “core”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does it let you do? In general, it allows a “renderer” to be registered and mods to interface with it using an API that extends the vanilla model/static rendering system. This way, the “renderer” can process and handle modded quads and models in the most efficient and optimal manner for itself, while mods can use a common API without fear of incompatibilities. There are currently two renderers available:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Indigo; this one is bundled with Fabric. It’s designed for being minimally invasive (OptiFine almost didn’t break it) and trying to expose exactly what vanilla’s engine allows for.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Canvas; this is a third-party renderer by Grondag, which rewrites the static rendering system to use a shader pipeline. It also exposes additional functionality via an extension API called FREX, such as custom GLSL shader materials or the ability to have multiple textures applied to the same quad.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, alongside this, we have added many features and bugfixes!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;[fabric-item-groups] Added translations (Bulgarian, German, Polish, Chinese).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;[fabric-networking] Fixed ByteBuf buffer leaks.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;[fabric-object-builders] Refactored FabricBlockSettings, added FabricMaterialBuilder for easy access to other material flags.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;[fabric-rendering-fluids] New module, allowing for hooking the vanilla fluid renderer with custom texturing.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;[fabric-textures] Add proper support for registering sprite registration callbacks to specific, non-block sprite atlases (such as the particle sprite atlas).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many more modules in the pipeline, extending the available hooks in regards to biomes, particles, loot tables, registry events and more - so stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Fabric is out for Minecraft 1.14.2, giving us access to more performance improvements and bugfixes!

The fixes are pretty important in this one:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Changed many errors and exceptions across Loader to provide more information.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fixed the famous “API 0.3.0 stutter bug”, which occured upon loading classes contained in nested JARs.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Developers: Fixed crashes pertaining to the use of -Dmixin.debug and similar functionality.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Developers: Updated Mixin library to .36
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Fixed annotation processor rejecting interface methods (as added with Loader 0.4.5)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Fixed INVOKEDYNAMICs not being remapped in development environments&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Fixed LVT error messages (Chocohead)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, Loom 0.2.3 has been in circulation for some time. The key change is that the “jar” tasks now outputs a -dev JAR on its own, whereas “remapJar” turns it into a properly mapped JAR - this helps a lot with buildscript handling and subprojects. (Also, more bugfixes!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The slow process of merging PRs into API 0.3.0 is also ongoing - more on that on the 1.14.2 update post…&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Loader 0.4.8 is now out!

&lt;p&gt;With it, I’d like to bring you a brief update of what has changed in the Fabric ecosystem since &lt;a href=&quot;https://fabricmc.net/2019/04/23/114.html&quot;&gt;the last version update&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;users&quot;&gt;Users&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;mods&quot;&gt;Mods&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are, as of writing, more than 140 mods available on CurseForge for 1.14, and more than 220 available for 1.14 snapshots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to keep in mind that, due to CurseForge’s delay in adding 1.14 as a selectable category, there were - and potentially still are - unfortunately some mods which were targetting stable 1.14, but were marked as available only for 1.14-Snapshot. We have tried to reach out to developers and ensure this is corrected, and we apologize for any related confusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for 1.14.1 version changes, unfortunately some important breaking changes have been made to block entity registration - we have decided to allow mods to update to them on their own, but this shouldn’t take long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;modpacks&quot;&gt;Modpacks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With 1.14, we released a proof-of-concept modpack called the “LaunchPack”, which showcased some highlights of mods being developed under Fabric. Nowadays, multiple modpacks are available which are based on Fabric, such as &lt;em&gt;Fabric Ultimate&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;All of Fabric&lt;/em&gt;. Unfortunately, they are primarily distributed through our Discord chatrooms and cloud-based downloads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However! This should begin to change soon - Fabric modpacks can now be distributed not just via MultiMC instances and MCUpdater packs, but also &lt;a href=&quot;https://fabricmc.net/wiki/modpack:technic&quot;&gt;Technic Solder&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://fabricmc.net/wiki/modpack:atlauncher&quot;&gt;ATLauncher&lt;/a&gt;. This should make it much easier to share, play and enjoy Fabric-based modpacks!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also a few Fabric-based servers running in production, proving its viability for multiplayer gameplay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;improvements&quot;&gt;Improvements&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were many key fixes done since the 23rd of April of importance to end users, including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Realms now works correctly,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;connecting to Spigot/BungeeCord-based servers works correctly (in API 0.3.0+),&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;setting up dedicated servers is now much easier than ever before.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of these were edge cases we didn’t catch during the snapshot cycle - sorry!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;developers&quot;&gt;Developers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;fabric-api&quot;&gt;Fabric API&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are aware that the API has been stagnating for a while. However, we have finally finished our big modularization plan with API 0.3.0-pre, and are proceeding to add new features once more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;fabric-loader&quot;&gt;Fabric Loader&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We fixed the Heisenbug! The one which caused weird, unexplainable crashes that seemed to “go away” randomly for some people, that is. (It took us far too long and I’m sorry.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have also added some features to Mixin centered around better support for interface method injection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;fabric-loom&quot;&gt;Fabric Loom&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Loom is now updated to 0.2.3. It provides additional bugfixes in the area of multi-project handling, as well as support for offline builds and - importantly:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A feature to &lt;a href=&quot;https://fabricmc.net/wiki/tutorial:migratemappings&quot;&gt;automatically migrate Java source code to a new mapping version&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have also documented how to &lt;a href=&quot;https://fabricmc.net/wiki/tutorial:cursegradle&quot;&gt;use CurseGradle with Fabric Loom&lt;/a&gt;, for those of you looking into such a feature.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Fabric is out for Minecraft 1.14.1, giving us access to the many performance improvements and bugfixes brought in that version!</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Toolchain updates - Loader 0.4.5, Loom 0.2.2</title><link href="http://fabricmc.net/2019/04/28/loader-045.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Toolchain updates - Loader 0.4.5, Loom 0.2.2" /><published>2019-04-28T00:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2019-04-28T00:00:00+02:00</updated><id>http://fabricmc.net/2019/04/28/loader-045</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://fabricmc.net/2019/04/28/loader-045.html">&lt;p&gt;Loader 0.4.5 is now out, with a bunch of changes! As we haven’t made a post for 0.4.3 or 0.4.4, here’s a changelog for all:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Loader 0.4.3
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;(Really) fixed Realms support!&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Improved Mixin’s Java version handling - “early access” versions, such as “13-ea” (Java 13), are now detected correctly.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Trying to launch a Minecraft instance with ModLoader will now automatically trigger use of the “compatibility” class loader it requires.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Loader 0.4.4
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;New server launching method (requires Installer 0.4.0+), with nowhere near as much complexity as the one introduced in 0.4.0&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Fixed minor, hypothetical Mixin bug&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Loader 0.4.5
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Added support for injecting into static and default interface methods with Mixin&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Fixed Mixin failures on certain non-English locales&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Fixed Mixin not being allowed to inject anonymous classes&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Fixed version comparisons not being parsed according to specification&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Fixed regressions introduced in 0.4.4&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For developers, there’s Loom 0.2.2, which is another small step in de-kludgifying our build system. Changes include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“modCompile” is now transitive. As of the latest builds of 0.2.1, the POM generated by &lt;em&gt;maven-publish&lt;/em&gt; is correct as to the required dependencies - the deprecated &lt;em&gt;maven&lt;/em&gt; plugin should not be used.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Backported the following Loom 0.3 features:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Improved “genSources” handling (minor performance boost, progress logging, etc.),&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Improved mod resolution.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve seen a lot of awesome work in the Fabric ecosystem in the past week. It’s awesome! Thank you so much!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Loader 0.4.5 is now out, with a bunch of changes!

&lt;p&gt;When I initially created a small GitHub organization called “ChorusMC” in August 2016, I couldn’t possibly have predicted that &lt;del&gt;Prismarine&lt;/del&gt; &lt;del&gt;Chorus&lt;/del&gt; Fabric would ever become more than a small experiment, a proof of concept - yet here we are, in the late days of April, over two years later, celebrating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d like to announce the &lt;strong&gt;immediate release&lt;/strong&gt; of the Fabric toolchain for Minecraft 1.14, complete with a &lt;strong&gt;proof-of-concept “launch modpack”&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/ur-OBoUc_nA&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does this mean for modders and developers? Honestly, not that much - it’s an update, just like any other update. Most of them are used to the process by now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does this mean for end users? It means that you can play modded 1.14 &lt;em&gt;today&lt;/em&gt;, with all of the mods built on top of the Fabric toolchain for its ecosystem - in fact, to prove it, we have put together a small modpack with a hand-picked selection of them!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can currently download it in two forms:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;as a MCUpdater instance: download MCUpdater from &lt;a href=&quot;https://files.mcupdater.com/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, then click the “+” button to add &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;https://asie.pl/files/FabricLaunchPack/1.14.xml&lt;/code&gt; to your modpack list. This has the benefit of keeping your modpack up-to-date (though we are unlikely to update it other than to fix bugs, as it is a proof-of-concept/”unstable” pack),&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;as a MultiMC instance &lt;a href=&quot;https://asie.pl/files/FabricLaunchPack/LaunchPack-1.0.0-1.14.zip&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;del&gt;(As of writing this post, 1.14 was not yet available in MultiMC’s version list - this should be fixed within hours if not minutes, however.)&lt;/del&gt; Should work fine now!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be warned that not very many people have played with Fabric on a production instance yet, and so bugs may still lurk - if so, report them to us immediately! Someone will definitely help you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I would like to thank many, many people, who helped make this release a reality. (I know we did it last time, but there’s more now, and thanking is important!) In no particular order, they are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;modmuss50&lt;/strong&gt;, the community co-admin and great supporter of the project, helping maintain various areas of it when I had burned out, and providing the initial build system and installer.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;shadowfacts&lt;/strong&gt;, one of the crucial contributors in the project’s early days as a set of mappings for 1.11 snapshots. Alongside &lt;strong&gt;copygirl&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;jamierocks&lt;/strong&gt;, comprising some of the earliest contributors to the project,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thog&lt;/strong&gt;, whose tireless work gave us a version of Enigma ready for the collaborative needs of the Fabric project; later, this work was taken up and continued by &lt;strong&gt;Gegy&lt;/strong&gt;,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Player&lt;/strong&gt;, whose generous sharing of Matcher, development of tiny-remapper and constant guidance on API design cannot ever go unnoticed,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grondag&lt;/strong&gt;, winner of the pull request review endurance award for the 1.14 snapshot cycle,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Many, &lt;em&gt;many&lt;/em&gt; contributors, too numerous to name here (When you see them around, say hi!),&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Every single modder who has contributed to the growth of the Fabric ecosystem. All of you. You’re awesome. Stay awesome.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is thanks to the hard work and dedication of our community that we’re able to do all of those things. This isn’t the end of our hard work on the Fabric ecosystem, of course. Stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First off, Loader 0.4.2:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When loading mods, all exceptions in a given entrypoint stage are now logged and printed at the end of it, in order to catch more failing mods in one go,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;(Really) minor game loading time optimizations,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fixed Realms plugin injection,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;General code cleanup and trimming down ugly hacks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, something that has been around for some time but without much fanfare - Loom 0.2.1. As the build environment tends to be much more of a rolling release, here are some highlights:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Subprojects support!&lt;/strong&gt; It is still being fixed around the edges, but generally - it means that you can define mod subprojects in Gradle,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Major&lt;/strong&gt; performance boosts in general use, with a significant part of the work coming from Chocohead,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fixed support for using file(…) in modCompiles, once again thanks to Chocohead.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know we promised Loom 0.3, but it appears the much hackier 0.2.x branch is with us to stay for a while longer. As Loom is in eternal development, there are features which we’re still working on, most notably proper support for either nested JARs or transitive dependencies - this is going to be necessary for Fabric API 0.3.0+. As always, thank you for sticking with Fabric - and see you soon!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">More toolchain updates!</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Loader 0.4.1</title><link href="http://fabricmc.net/2019/04/13/loader-041.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Loader 0.4.1" /><published>2019-04-13T00:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2019-04-13T00:00:00+02:00</updated><id>http://fabricmc.net/2019/04/13/loader-041</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://fabricmc.net/2019/04/13/loader-041.html">&lt;p&gt;Quick update - after the slightly imperfect release of Loader 0.4.0, we’re bringing the bugfix version 0.4.1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Changelog:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Added a mapping resolution API for developers! This should be a big step in making reflection/method handle accesses to Minecraft code dev/prod-friendly without much hassle.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Minor mod loading time optimizations.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fixed dedicated server support.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Unfortunately, for the time being this means using the Fabric installer to create a server install + dropping the server JAR in yourself. Sorry!&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Actually&lt;/em&gt; fixed all of the Mixin-features-in-development-environment-dependencies corner cases.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Tested on Arcane Magic, which has quite a few of them, so it must be true.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Updated libraries: tiny-remapper.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for being a part of the Fabric community!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Quick update - after the slightly imperfect release of Loader 0.4.0, we’re bringing the bugfix version 0.4.1.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Loader 0.4.0 and the winds of Spring</title><link href="http://fabricmc.net/2019/04/07/loader-04.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Loader 0.4.0 and the winds of Spring" /><published>2019-04-07T00:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2019-04-07T00:00:00+02:00</updated><id>http://fabricmc.net/2019/04/07/loader-04</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://fabricmc.net/2019/04/07/loader-04.html">&lt;p&gt;I know blog posts (and development) has slowed down recently. I suppose it is fair to attribute this to a burnout on my - asie’s, that is - side. Keeping up a consistent development pace on a hobby project is very
difficult, and it appears I reached my breaking point for a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, today I have finally dusted off old changes and am ready to release the not-perfect-but-nonetheless-good Loader 0.4.0.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The changes are numerous, but include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://fabricmc.net/wiki/format:modjson&quot;&gt;New, formalized mod metadata schema format!&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Now with a proper modder-side API!&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Actual versioning and dependency resolution!&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;More powerful entrypoint system to replace initiailizers! Provide static fields and even method handles!&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Nested JARs, cooperating with said dependency resolution to allow you to provide any dependency you want - leave the rest to the mod loader!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Support for a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of Minecraft versions. For now, we support:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;All vanilla client and server versions, from 0.0.11 all the way to 19w14b - and beyond!&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;All versions of Risguami’s ModLoader*,&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Versions of Forge for 1.2.5 and below*.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mixin reference maps are now remapped at runtime in development environment dependencies.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;This removes a bunch of Loom-side hackery, and finally fixes Accessor/Invoker support in this scenario!&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Major refactors in Knot, our default class loader.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Stub providing of Package/CodeSource objects - fixing a few crashes here and there.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The server .JAR filename is now stored in a properties file - this is useful for better interop with many existing server hosting systems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please note that the ModLoader/Forge support (a) requires enabling a flag for a “compatibility” class loader mode, (b) does not yet allow you to mixin non-Fabric mods themselves. However, it &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; work on Java 9+!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for mod compatibility, most mods should work just fine - there is a decent amount of 0.3.x compatibility. However, there are some exceptions we’re aware of:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mod Menu&lt;/strong&gt; may run into issues during gameplay, but basic functionality works fine.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;plugin-loader&lt;/strong&gt; does not work with 0.4.x! Disable it in your instance and encourage your local mod author to adopt entrypoints in its place - they’re as good if not better.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With regards to modders, there are some scribbled notes on updating to Loader 0.4.x &lt;a href=&quot;https://fabricmc.net/wiki/tutorial:loader04x&quot;&gt;right here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope you will enjoy the new, long-awaited features in Loader! What’s coming next?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Loom 0.3.0 is still being worked on. It probably won’t come out in a day or two, but should be out soon-ish. As a stop-gap, Loom 0.2.1 is being worked on by modmuss50 to add nested JAR functionality to your existing development environments.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There is renewed debate and implementation work on the configuration system. Hopefully, it will make it to Loader 0.5.0.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There are discussions on the future of Fabric’s API component - nothing concrete to announce as of yet. We are aware of its mild stagnation, don’t worry!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PS. How’s Yarn doing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Type&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Yarn 19w07a.13&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Yarn 19w14b.4&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Total Change&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Classes&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;90.99%&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;94.23%&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;+3.24%&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Fields&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;74.53%&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;82.33%&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;+7.80%&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Methods&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;70.85%&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;73.26%&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;+2.41%&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
