## About XMC

XMC as a server began as Moonlight SMP all the way back in April of 2019. As a network, however, we began around March of that year. It was this month that we introduced a second server to our name.

We have since expanded to have a staff team of four great people, and three great servers. We have a favorite staff member, guess who it is!
